            Our team spent years building products for
            <a href="https://www.resource.io/">recruiters</a>. In parallel, we
            also spent countless hours creating unique experiences for our own
            candidates by tailoring our interview process for each of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can imagine, this is painfully time consuming - but itâ€™s our
            biggest recruiting secret weapon. Tailoring our interview experience
            for each candidate gave us a tremendous advantage over our
            competition and helps us repeatedly win talent from top brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Today weâ€™re launching
              <a href="https://candidate.guide/">Guide</a> to empower every
              hiring team to wow their candidates, virtually and in
              person.</strong

            With unemployment skyrocketing and millions of candidates flooding
            the job market, they need this now more than ever. And itâ€™s not just
            for candidates - thereâ€™s a business case too.
          </p>
          <h3 id="why-your-candidate-experience-matters-">
            <strong>Why your candidate experience matters.</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The experience you give candidates becomes your brand. People
            remember how you treat them. They tell their friends, share their
            experiences online and in many cases, they remember their
            interactions with you for life. Now, as most interviews have shifted
            to virtual nearly overnight, delivering a memorable experience is
            even harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's your brand, sure, and it's also more than that. Most poor
            hiring outcomes are a result of misaligned or incomplete
            expectations during the interview process itself, leading to under
            performance, lower engagement and worse retention from new hires.
            More informed candidates make better decisions which leads to better
            hiring outcomes: better performance, higher engagement and longer
            retention. In other words, better hires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guide helps you deliver a radically personal interview experience so
            you can win more of your best candidates.

          <p>Be warned: they're gonna love it. &nbsp;</p>
