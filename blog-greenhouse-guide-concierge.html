            We’re thrilled to announce that Guide has been recognized by
            <a href="https://www.greenhouse.io/">Greenhouse</a>, the hiring
            software company, as a
            <a

              >Customer-Preferred Partner</a
            >. With this partnership, Guide joins an exclusive group of the most
            valuable partner integrations chosen by existing Greenhouse
            customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of this announcement, we’ve launched a unique new offering
            for Greenhouse customers,
            <a href="https://guide.co/concierge">Guide Concierge</a>. Now,
            Greenhouse customers can try Guide for free for 30 days with 1-on-1
            implementation help from our in-house Candidate Experience
            Specialists.

            Why Greenhouse customers voted for candidate experience
          </h2>
          <p>
            For both talent teams and candidates, the trend towards hiring with
            transparency and humanity isn’t slowing down with the broader
            financial markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Guide’s recognition as a Greenhouse Customer-Preferred Partner
            validates the impact that Greenhouse customers are seeing from
            investing in candidate experience,” says Troy Sultan, Guide’s CEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Greenhouse customers are the most progressive with new technology.
            We're seeing top organizations improving processes they couldn’t
            prioritize during the hiring frenzy. Now more than ever, every offer
            that you extend counts. And teams who choose not to invest in
            near-perfect offer acceptance rates are losing precious time and
            money.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re grateful for the outspoken feedback from so many Greenhouse
            customers who drive Guide’s recognition as a
            <a
              href="https://www.greenhouse.io/integrations?category=customer-preferred&amp;q=&amp;page=1"

            We listened: reduced time and cost of improving your candidate
            experience
          </h2>
          <p>
            Over the past several months, we’ve spoken to hundreds of talent
            teams and leaders who want to invest in candidate experience.
            Because of limited bandwidth or ever-elusive buy-in from financial
            stakeholders, they can’t give promising technologies a shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve listened to these challenges closely. With the launch of Guide
            Concierge, we’ve made it faster and easier to experience the
            benefits immediately - without time, cost, or risk.
