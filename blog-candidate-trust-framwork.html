            In recent years, Talent and Recruiting teams have seen record
            spending on top-of-funnel efforts to source and attract candidates
            for hard-to-fill roles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, this has resulted in an epidemic of wasted time,
            money, and resources as those same TA teams report low candidate
            engagement, unwanted candidate drop-off throughout their hiring
            funnel, and worse, poorly performing hires. Whether we’re facing a
            bullish or bearish economy (but *especially* the latter) it’s
            imperative for modern TA teams to make every candidate interaction
            count, which means doubling down on candidate experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years as a talent acquisition leader and nearly a decade
            working with the most successful talent teams and leaders on the
            planet at

          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, I share a new way to define, measure, and improve the
            candidate experience - which I call the Candidate TRUST Framework.
            If you hire humans for a living, this framework applies to you,
            regardless of your industry, job function, or hiring philosophy.<br /><br />I'm
            excited to share what I've learned. Let's dive in.
          </p>
          <h2 id="the-big-debate-about-candidate-experience">
            <strong>The Big Debate About Candidate Experience</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            For years, a circular and unproductive debate has been raging among
            Talent Acquisition leaders: what <em>is</em> candidate experience
            exactly, and how should we measure it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Talk to just a few TA leaders and you’ll quickly learn that
            “candidate experience” means different things to different people.
            Definitions vary from “the series of interactions a job seeker has
            with your organization throughout the recruitment process” to “how a
            job seeker perceives a company's brand throughout the hiring
            process.” But what does this mean in practice?
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, if we can’t agree as an industry on a definition for
            candidate experience, we can’t agree on a way to measure it. And
            that’s a problem for all of us. Without a universal framework for
            measuring candidate experience, the TA industry deprives itself of
            practical benchmarks, shared best practices, and other vital tools
            for improvement. This hurts organizations, TA teams, and candidates
            alike. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This ambiguity has forced talent acquisition teams to repurpose
            metrics from adjacent verticals in hopes to capture
            <em>some </em>way to measure candidate experience. Or worse, they
            don’t measure it at all. Have you used NPS (a
            <em>customer</em> experience metric), CSAT (a
            <em>customer</em> satisfaction metric), or a cocktail of others to
            measure your candidate experience? I certainly have.
          </p>
          <h3 id="why-should-you-care-about-candidate-experience">
            Why should you care about candidate experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you've read this far, I'll assume you already understand the
            importance of a quality candidate experience. Here's today's
            reality: job candidates now view their interview experience as a
            window into what it’s like to actually work at the organization.
            Many industry studies have reported on factors such as the
            percentage of unhappy candidates who share their experience with
            family and friends (<a
              href="https://www.careerarc.com/lp/candidate-experience-study/"
              >72%</a
            >); who won’t do business with you again (<a
              href="https://www.thetalentboard.org/press-releases/talent-board-2016-north-american-candidate-experience-research-report-now-available/"
              >41%</a
            >); or who actively avoid companies with poor Glassdoor reviews (<a
              href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2019/09/22/why-online-employer-reviews-are-crucial-to-your-branding/"
              >57%</a
            >).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A bad candidate experience can lead to
              <strong>lost talent</strong>,
              <strong>higher recruiting costs</strong>,
              <strong>slower time to hire</strong>, and
              <strong>negative Glassdoor reviews</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A positive candidate experience can lead to a
              <strong>contagious talent brand</strong> (even and especially
              amongst rejected candidates),
              <strong>increased referrals</strong>,
              <strong>lower recruiting costs</strong>,
              <strong>faster time to hire</strong>, and a
              <strong>competitive advantage </strong>for an organization.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Think back to the last time you had a poor interview experience: how
            did it impact your perception of that organization?
          </p>
          <p>
            Any TA leader who doesn’t understand the business impact of a great
            candidate experience soon, I’m afraid, may not be a modern TA leader
            for long.
          </p>
          <h2 id="a-new-definition-for-candidate-experience">
            <strong>A New Definition for Candidate Experience</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before we dive into how to measure and improve candidate experience,
            let's agree on a definition. Let’s first break down the phrase into
            its constituent parts, “candidate” and “experience.” This sounds
            silly but it’s important, so bear with me.
          </p>
          <h3 id="what-is-a-candidate">What is a "candidate"?</h3>
          <p>
            From the point of view of a talent team, what exactly qualifies
            someone as a candidate?
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a fan of the definition Kevin Grossman’s proposes in his book,
            <em
              ><a

                >A candidate is anyone who has formally expressed an interest in
                working for you, qualified or not.</strong
              ></em
            >
          </p>
          <p>This alone un-muddies the candidate experience waters a bit.</p>
          <h3 id="ok-then-what-is-experience">
            Ok then, what is "experience"?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Where does the candidate experience start and when does it stop?
            When our definition of “candidate” is layered against a simplistic
            hiring funnel (see below), it becomes more clear what part of the
            experience happens during candidacy, and what doesn’t.

            I propose that a candidate is still a candidate (<em
              >and having an experience...</em
            >) until their first day of work when they become employees,
            governed by the <em>employee</em> experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, most (if not all) definitions I’ve heard in my career are
            framed from the point of view of the <em>employer</em>. This is
            antithetical to the very essence of what we're after. Remember, it’s
            the<em> candidate’s</em> experience we’re talking about, not the
            employer's (or talent team’s).
          </p>
          <h3 id="putting-them-together">Putting them together</h3>
          <p>
            Therefore, any acceptable definition of candidate experience must be
            defined<em> from the point of view of the candidate: </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Candidate experience is the emotional journey of a candidate from
              the moment they apply until their first day of work.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            This emotional journey is the result<em> </em>of all interactions a
            candidate has with your company. This includes with your
            <a href="https://guide.co/product/">technology</a>, hiring team
            (recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, and any other
            representation of the company), your employer brand, and more. The
            <em>candidate’s perception </em>is the cash value of all investments
            you make in your candidate experience. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe this definition serves as the most effective foundation
            for instrumenting a measurement framework and making improvements.
          </p>

            That’s right:

              >candidate experience should be measured by the

          <p>
            The Candidate TRUST methodology is a new way to measure and analyze
            the candidate experience throughout the interview journey, designed
            specifically for talent acquisition teams. It is a framework that
            allows talent teams to identify a specific driver contributing to a
            poor candidate experience so they can focus efforts to improve it.
            Most importantly, it is designed to help talent teams and their
            organizations look through a new lens: the candidate's.

          <h3 id="the-5-pillars-of-candidate-trust">
            The 5 Pillars of Candidate Trust
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are 5 key measures (or “pillars” as I call them) which, when
            measured and summed, equate to the level of trust you’ve earned in
            the eyes of your candidates at each stage of the hiring journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            By measuring each pillar, we can then calculate the Candidate Trust
            Score (more on that later) to understand the impact and
            effectiveness of your candidate experience efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            TRUST is an acronym for these 5 underlying pillars that drive the
            oh-so-elusive emotional state we’re looking to create:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>T</strong>ransparency</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>eciprocity</li>
            <li><strong>U</strong>nity</li>
            <li><strong>S</strong>peed</li>
            <li><strong>T</strong>ruthfulness</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Now, let’s dive into the importance of each pillar.</p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The highest-ranking organizations on the transparency pillar deliver
            consistent and proactive candidate communications from application
            to onboarding. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Clearly-set expectations up-front about what the hiring process
              entails from start to finish
            </li>
            <li>
              Detailed information about the <em>next step</em> of the interview
              process
            </li>
            <li>
              Robust responses to candidate curiosities, and over time,
              proactively sharing answers to previously asked questions (think:
              a candidate FAQ doc)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your candidates are left wondering “what’s next?”, “when will I
            hear back?”, “how did I do?”, “when will there be space to ask
            questions” at any point during their experience, you are at risk of
            scoring low on the transparency pillar and losing the candidate’s
            trust.

          <h4 id="rreciprocity">R- Reciprocity</h4>
          <p>

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The highest-ranking organizations on the reciprocity pillar make the
            candidate feel fully invested in and respected. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Demonstrating respect for the candidate’s time by following
              through on commitments made and sharing the “why” behind changes
              (when rescheduling an interview, for example)
            </li>
            <li>
              Addressing candidate questions or concerns as they arise (instead
              of setting aside time at the end of the process)
            </li>
            <li>
              Proactively offering opportunities for candidates to “reverse
              interview” current employees
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Teams who leave candidates feeling that they’ve invested more in the
            interview process than has been reciprocated are likely to rank low
            on the reciprocity pillar. In contrast, candidates who perceive the
            information exchange and time investments as equal on both sides
            score higher on this pillar of trust.
          </p>
          <h4 id="uunity">U- Unity</h4>

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            We call this “unity.” The highest-ranking organizations on the unity
            pillar make the candidate feel included and treated fairly. This
            includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stating clearly how the candidate will be evaluated at each step
              of the interview process, and how the hiring decision will be made
            </li>
            <li>
              Adequately training each interviewer and ensuring a structured
              hiring process is in place
            </li>
            <li>
              Decisions - especially rejections - are communicated directly and
              with empathy, and include helpful feedback the candidate can learn
              from when possible
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Candidates who feel like outsiders to the organization struggle to
            imagine themselves as part of the group. This perception can lead to
            the organization ranking low on the pillar of unity. Leaning into
            the tactics above can garner higher scores on this pillar.
          </p>

              throughout their candidacy?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            “Speed” often means a faster hiring process, but not always. The
            highest-ranking organizations on the speed pillar move at the
            <em>ideal</em> pace as perceived by the candidate. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ask the candidate up front what their preferred pacing would be
              during the interview process (ie. are they hoping to move as fast
              as possible because of a time constraint, or do they want to move
              slowly to account for their other priorities?)
            </li>
            <li>
              Where possible, changing the interview pace at various junctures
              during the interview process based on candidate preferences
            </li>
            <li>
              Clearly communicate the timing and pace the candidate can expect
              at each step, regardless of whether it aligns with their
              preferences
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Moving at the ideal pace isn’t always possible, but it does help to
            build trust with the candidate. Organizations who simply ask
            candidates up front for their ideal timeline receive higher scores
            on this trust pillar, even if they couldn’t fully honor this
            preference - as long as that expectation was clearly communicated.
            <br /><br />When all else is controlled for, on average, the faster
            an organization can evaluate a candidate and arrive at a hiring
            decision, the higher their score on the speed pillar. Faster
            interview processes also correlate positively with fewer candidate
            withdrawals and higher offer acceptance rates.

          <p>
            <strong
              >Does the candidate feel your organization has been truthful with
              all information shared throughout their candidacy?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If at any point during a hiring process your candidate feels you’re
            not being truthful, it undermines the goodwill built within any
            other pillar, and thus, reduces trust. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Providing honest feedback and accurate information throughout the
              interview process, and proactively correcting for any inaccurate
              information shared unintended
            </li>
            <li>
              “Showing the blemishes” - being open and upfront about the
              challenges the company faces, or with not-so-positive news that
              arises during the process (ie. addressing negative press or
              managerial changes)
            </li>
            <li>
              Following through on the commitments made by a representative at
              the company (ie. updating the candidate when promised or providing
              a “no update update” if there isn’t news to share as expected)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This might be the most counterintuitive pillar to put into practice
            for talent teams, as we tend to avoid these tactics in hopes to
            build <em>more</em> trust. But instead, it does the opposite and
            drives trust scores down. Teams who “hug the elephant” learn quickly
            that it earns trust and drives up win rates.

            <strong>The Candidate Trust Survey</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Measuring candidate trust in practice means surveying candidates and
            calculating your Candidate Trust Score (CTS) from the results. Below
            I cover how to successfully conduct the survey and calculate a
            Candidate Trust Score across all five pillars, as well as a score
            for each pillar - so you know exactly where to improve.
          </p>
          <h3 id="candidate-trust-survey-methodology">
            Candidate Trust Survey Methodology
          </h3>
          <h4 id="survey-type">Survey type</h4>
          <p>
            A survey is like a snapshot: from one survey, you can only draw
            conclusions about a single time, place, and group of people. And
            often, that’s all you need to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in the case of candidate experience, we want to understand how
            the candidate’s experience changes over time at various points
            during their candidate journey. For that reason, one single survey,
            or snapshot, isn’t enough, so we need to repeat surveys at several
            “moments” during the interview process to track and understand
            trends over time, illuminating when and where trust is built or lost
            with candidates throughout their experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand changes in candidate trust over time, we’ve chosen a
            survey that lets us “follow” the candidate (or group of candidates)
            and ask the same questions over a period of time - for days, weeks,
            or even months - to gauge their emotional state at various moments
            throughout their experience. In Nerdlandia, this is called a
            “longitudinal” survey.
          </p>
          <h4 id="survey-questions">Survey questions</h4>
          <p>
            To measure each pillar of candidate trust, we chose what the survey
            research field calls the “agree/disagree” approach, which gives
            candidates a range of answer options from strongly agree to strongly
            disagree. It allows candidates to answer each question more
            precisely and it provides you with more nuanced responses to
            analyze.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following questions were developed to measure each of the 5
            pillars of candidate trust:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>[Transparency]</strong> I have felt a high degree of
              transparency during my interview experience so far.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>[Reciprocity] </strong>I have felt an equal sense of
              give-and-take during my interview experience so far.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>[Unity] </strong>I have felt a high degree of fairness and
              inclusion during my interview experience so far.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>[Speed]</strong> I have felt satisfied with the pace of my

              truthfulness during my interview experience so far.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br />Q: I feel {{company}} has been

          <p>
            When administering the survey, there are a few principles to follow
            to ensure the integrity of your results, reduce bias and encourage
            candidate honesty:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Anonymous submissions: </strong>To increase survey
              response rates and ensure candidates feel safe being honest,
              ensure their identity is protected (and they know that).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Escrowed responses: </strong>Take anonymity one step
              further by letting candidates know that, although you’ll be
              surveying them at various points during the interview process,
              their responses are only reviewed<em> after</em> the hiring
              decision has been made. And in no circumstances will their survey
              responses impact the hiring decision. Reassuring candidates of
              these “escrowed” responses will increase survey response rates and
              improve the honesty of the responses.
            </li>

              >For a longitudinal survey like the CTS, you’ll want to decide how
              frequently to survey candidates. If you conduct surveys too
              frequently, you’ll risk wasting resources and time since not
              enough time may have passed for any change to occur. If you
              conduct surveys too infrequently, you may not be able to detect
              the key moments where candidate trust changes. We’ve found the
              optimal timing and frequency to survey candidates is immediately
              after they complete the final interview within each interview
              stage.

              substantially different answers, even from the same respondents.
              So to analyze results with the highest accuracy, you should ask
              the same questions in every survey you repeat.

            For each pillar of TRUST, you can view the data using a bar graph to
            understand that pillar’s health. As responses come in, you’ll notice
            visually where the survey responses skew. For example, the graph
            below shows the majority of candidates who responded (roughly 70%)
            either somewhat disagree or strongly disagree that they have felt a
            high degree of transparency during their interview experience.

          </p>
          <p>
            This allows us to easily calculate a score for each pillar by
            averaging the response values. Continuing with the transparency
            example above, we get an average transparency score of 2.18 by
            <strong
              >adding each response’s value together and then dividing by the
              total number of responses.

          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, 20 respondents chose “Strongly disagree” each of
            which has a value of 1. 26 respondents selected “Somewhat disagree,”
            each of which has a value of 2. And so on. So the equation we arrive
            at is:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">
            (20*1) + (26*2) + (10*3) + (8*4) + (2*5) &nbsp;= 144
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            We then divide that number (144) by the total number of responses
            (66) and we get a transparency score for this cohort of 2.18.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">144 / 66 = 2.18</blockquote>

            surveys resulted in the following scores for each pillar:

            The “X-Ray” - Graphing CTS Across the Candidate Journey
          </h3>
          <p>
            As you gather data for candidates at multiple stages of the
            interview process, you can then plot their Candidate Trust Score
            over the course of their journey. This becomes powerful since you
            can then create the same graph for an individual candidate, a group
            of candidates (e.g. by department or role), or all candidates
            throughout the interview process for that cohort of candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your end result will be a visual representation of where candidate
            trust rises and falls throughout the interview journey, illuminating
            where improvements can be made.

            <strong>A Trustworthy Future for Candidate Experience</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’m excited for a future where candidates genuinely trust the
            companies they’re interviewing with to be transparent, respectful,
            fair, fast, and honest. And it goes without saying but a future
            where companies trust they’ll get the same from their candidates. As
            humans, without trust, we have little holding our relationships
            together. Hiring great talent and finding work we love depends on
            those relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're interested in calculating your Candidate Trust Score and
            are not currently using the

            In a future post, we’ll publish benchmarks and insights on how
            Candidate Trust Scores correlate to critical recruiting metrics like
            passthrough rates, time-to-hire, and offer acceptance rates.
