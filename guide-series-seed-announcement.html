          <p>
            Anyone who‚Äôs interviewed for a job knows how much of a black box the
            experience can be. Being in the dark constantly about where you
            stand and what to expect next, if you hear back from the company at
            all. It can be frustrating and demoralizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking behind the curtain at the organizations that are hiring,
            you‚Äôll learn that their recruiters aren‚Äôt to blame. They‚Äôre
            challenged with a black box of their own. Recruiting teams don‚Äôt
            have visibility into which candidates are most engaged and why. This
            makes it incredibly difficult to deliver the personalized experience
            that each individual deserves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately this problem isn‚Äôt unique to smaller or less-resourced
            organizations. Even today‚Äôs most modern and well-staffed recruiting
            teams rely on generic email templates and PDFs to make an impression
            and differentiate themselves from a sea of companies competing for
            the same hires. In a candidate‚Äôs market, this isn‚Äôt enough to win.
          </p>

            <strong
              >Guide‚Äôs mission is to bring transparency and humanity to the
              hiring process.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            With Guide‚Äôs candidate experience platform, talent teams can invite
            their candidates into a single hub to access everything they need ‚Äî
            from personalized interview details to timelines, prep materials,
            interviewer bios, and more. And because Guide serves as the primary
            home base for candidates during the interview process, Guide unlocks
            insights to help talent teams identify which candidates are most
            engaged and which are at risk of dropping off.
          </p>
          <p>
            As candidates find themselves with more options than ever before,
            and as ‚Äúcandidate experience‚Äù becomes synonymous with a Zoom window,
            companies need to make an impression more than ever. Providing
            transparency and a personalized approach not only increases
            candidate engagement and trust, but is a proven way to drive up
            conversion rates and make more hires faster.

          <p>
            We‚Äôre still in the early innings of candidate experience and we‚Äôre
            excited to invest in a new category of software that improves the
            lives of candidates and recruiters. Today with Guide, recruiters can
            make an amazing impression on candidates with just a few clicks, and
            candidates can make more informed job decisions with increased
            transparency and personalization. We‚Äôre thankful for early customers
            like Gitlab, Glossier, MongoDB and One Medical who‚Äôve helped Guide
            reach and delight tens of thousands of candidates to date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking forward, we're intently focused on building a world class
            team to accelerate our vision for a more human candidate experience

            enrich the end candidate experience and deliver more insights to
            recruiters and hiring managers, plus deeper integrations with the
            tools they already use and love.
