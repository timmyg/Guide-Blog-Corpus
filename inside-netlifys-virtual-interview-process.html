            Tactic 1: A pre-designed “Zoom process”
          </h3>
          <p>
            Whether using Zoom or other video conferencing software, Darla
            emphasizes how vital it is to nail the specifics of how your video
            links get generated, shared and joined by interviewers and
            candidates to avoid logistical hiccups that can kill an interview.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The traditional method of creating Zoom calls just wasn’t working
            for us.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            One major improvement Netlify made was creating a more “organized”
            approach using Personal Meeting IDs for everyone at the company
            (“PMIs” are specific to Zoom). When doing virtual interviews,
            interviewers often use Zoom's auto-generated meeting room IDs
            through Zoom's Chrome extension or Calendar integration. This caused
            interview slots to get double-booked or scheduled over recurring
            meetings like 1:1s, generating error messages and a logistics
            nightmare for everyone involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this, Brandi created a "Zoom process" - a spreadsheet of
            every interviewer which includes their permanent PMI (found in Zoom
            settings), timezone, LinkedIn profile and personal bio. This doc
            became the source of truth that allows the recruiting team to copy
            any interviewer’s info into Greenhouse and the candidate’s interview
            guide (more on this soon), dramatically simplifying their workflow
            and making video calls easily accessible to the interviewer and
            candidate without scheduling conflicts.
          </p>

            Tactic 2: A transparent “interview guide” to share with candidates
          </h3>
          <p>
            Netlify cites “transparency” as one of their secret recruiting
            weapons. Darla describes the process of creating robust interview
            guides that get sent to all candidates at [the equivalent of] the
            onsite stage and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            This had such an impact for Netlify, they now share interview guides
            with candidates even earlier in the process, at the phone screen
            stage.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            It’s critical that the candidate understands the makeup of our
            interview process up front and has all the information at their
            fingertips. We communicate up front what each step of the interview
            process is expected to be, who they will be meeting with during each
            interview, how long we expect the process to take and detailed tips
            on how to prepare, like finding a quiet spot for the interview and
            making sure your AirPods are charged.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Darla touches on the biggest hurdle keeping more recruiters from
            doing this - the upfront cost:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We’re now use software for this, but initially we would painfully
            write long Greenhouse email templates summarizing our process, and
            even that was clearly worth it given the impact on our process.

          <p>
            Darla and Brandi both pointed out how details of the interview
            process like times and interviewers commonly change unexpectedly
            which causes many recruiters trepidation in being transparent up
            front. But the Netlify team sees potential changes as a genuine
            opportunity to build rapport with candidates through these
            additional touchpoints.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We try to maximize the amount of touchpoints with each candidate as
            long as each provides value or helps them get to know us better.
            We’ve never received feedback from a candidate that we over
            communicated.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Netlify flips a potential negative experience (ie. the process
            changing mid-flight) into an asset. As they explain, when a detail
            in the process changes it creates an opportunity to check in with
            the candidate, to let them know what’s going on and explain what to
            expect during the upcoming interview:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We may not even be in the pre-selling stage yet but with each
            touchpoint we build trust and candidates get increasingly bought in.
            They’re getting a real sense of what it’s like to work here.

            Tactic 3: A “tip sheet” to share with interviewers
          </h3>
          <p>
            Netlify encourages building a “tip sheet” - or even better, running
            a brief training session for interviewers - to outline best
            practices and common technology pitfalls so interviewers are
            prepared.
          </p>
          <p>Here's what a tip sheet might include:</p>

          <p>
            Like testing a product before you ship to live users, Netlify
            emphasizes doing a test run before you roll out the process to
            candidates. This is an easy way to fix bugs that will impact the
            candidate (and interviewer's) experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team also encouraged strong internal organization - the stuff
            the candidate doesn’t see - to ensure all goes smoothly during
            interviews. This includes fluid internal communication and feedback
            between interviews across recruiters and interviewers, via your ATS,
            or Slack in Netlify's case.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a final note, Brandi recommends surveying your interview team for
            any concerns about running a virtual interview process:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            It’s important to ensure that everyone on the interview team is
            comfortable with the virtual process. If they aren’t, it will impact
            all of their interviews.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Superpro-tip from Brandi:</em></strong> Include new
            hires in the interview process as interviewers. As your new
            employees onboard, they can refer back to their own candidate
            experience which services as training for how to be an effective
            interviewer at your company.
          </p>
          <h3 id="tactic-4-a-slack-channel-for-candidates-to-collaborate">
            Tactic 4: A Slack channel for candidates to collaborate
          </h3>
          <p>
            For engineering and other roles that require the candidate to
            complete a project as part of the interview process, Netlify uses
            Slack to engage the candidate in a meaningful way:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We do a project and invite them to a single slack channel. We let
            candidates know upfront that the coding project is done in slack to
            give them a chance to communicate live and interact with the
            engineering team and post questions.
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>How Netlify does it:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Once a candidate reached the project stage, the recruiter creates
              a Slack channel titled “#interview_candidatename” and invites the
              hiring manager and interview team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once they’re in, someone in the channel volunteers to be the "team
              captain" for this candidate. The captain is responsible for
              welcoming the candidate in Slack, sharing the project details and
              ensuring questions are answered. Oh, and sharing lots of emoji
              love.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the candidate is invited to the channel, they get a warm
              welcome by the team creating a friendly tone and to minimize the
              “this is a test” feel.
            </li>
            <li>
              The captain shares the project overview in the channel using a
              template which links to a pre-prepared Github repository for the
              project (for engineering candidates).
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the project is complete, the candidate uploads a zip the file
              which the team adds to Greenhouse with the scorecard for review.
              The recruiting team tells candidates up front that the channel
              will go dark after their project is submitted and is set to expire
              in 30 days. From here, primary communication with the candidate
              moves back to email.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Throughout the process, the candidate is encouraged to engage and
            interact with the Netlify team by asking questions to get a feel for
            what it’s like to work together:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We tell candidates that this is really an opportunity for you to see
            what it looks like to work here - an opportunity to focus on what’s
            in it for the candidate.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This part of Netlify’s process has another secret weapon built in.
            Because Netlify is a “Slack-first culture,” which they admit has its
            pros and cons, they value and assess a candidate’s collaboration
            style and level of engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brandi explains the importance of making their project stage an
            interactive experience designed to elicit responses, collaboration
            and communication in the Slack channel. Candidates who do well
            across Netlify's process tend to be engaged, communicative and ask
            questions.
          </p>
          <h3 id="tactic-5-a-gated-interview-process-with-lean-interview-teams">
            Tactic 5: A “gated” interview process with lean interview teams
          </h3>
          <p>
            Instead of waiting until the candidate finishes several interviews
            before making a decision, the Netlify team instead has a “gated”
            interview process (vs a “panel” style) whereby they make a decision
            to move forward after each individual interview. This protects both
            the candidate and interviewer’s time by avoiding unnecessary
            interviews.

            Brandi emphasizes how important it is to educate candidates up front
            about their gated interviews work so there are no surprises:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            When we do our initial screen with a candidate, we work diligently
            as a recruiting team to educate the candidate about our process,
            explaining how our gated process works so there are no surprises.
            Again and again we find that candidates appreciate transparency and
            show up better because of it.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Another design detail that improves the experience for candidates is
            the number of interviewers in each interview. Netlify aims for a
            maximum of 2 interviewers in each block. "We don’t do large group
            interviews over Zoom unless it’s an exception. We try to keep each
            interview to only the candidate and two interviewers max,” says
            Brandi.

          <h3 id="tactic-6-a-reverse-interview">
            Tactic 6: A reverse interview
          </h3>
          <p>Brandi, trying to melt our hearts:</p>
          <blockquote>
            The interview isn’t over until the candidates questions are
            answered.
          </blockquote>
          <p>This is about when we started begging for jobs at Netlify.</p>
          <p>
            Brandi explains the importance of the interview process being an
            equal, two-way street. She believes candidates should have an
            opportunity to learn as much about the company as the company gets
            to learn about them. Because it could be the start of a long-term
            relationship, it’s critical that both parties, especially the
            candidate, are making an informed decision. If the candidate is
            making a decision with incomplete information it’s a risk for both
            the candidate and the company.
          </p>
          <p>Brandi on transparency:</p>
          <blockquote>
            Our recruiters are an open book. We believe in fully open
            communications so both sides can make the best decision. That’s in
            everyone’s best interest over the long term.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            By the end of the interview process candidates have the opportunity
            to explore Netlify’s business and request meetings with anyone on
            the team - including the co-founders. This is what we dubbed a
            "reverse interview."
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Brandi, not every candidate takes them up on the offer
            but they notice that merely giving the option makes candidates less
            stressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is another opportunity to get the broader company involved in
            the hiring process. Brandi explains that each person at Netlify is
            part of the candidate experience, and part of the interview process:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We hire as an organization. As for the recruiting team, we're the
            conductor that keeps the train on the tracks. Hiring is a true
            organization-wide effort.
          </blockquote>
          <h3 id="tactic-7-a-feedback-session-for-candidate-rejections">
            Tactic 7: A "feedback session" for candidate rejections
          </h3>
          <p>
            When Netlify decides not to move forward with a candidate, they
            triple down on the human approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            They offer candidates a “feedback session” to explain the rationale
            for the decision, so they have the opportunity to learn and grow.
            This not only helps candidates who they reject, but it turns many
            into referral engines and Netlify brand evangelists. A highly
            differentiating part of Netlify’s process in the eyes of candidates
            is that they lead with empathy:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We stop and ask: how would we like to be treated? We try to lead
            with empathy. It's easy to come up with a strategy if you know your
            priority is the candidate first, because you can inform it with how
            you want to be treated.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This isn't easy, as Brandi notes. "It's not easy to get on a Zoom
            call face to face and tell a candidate that we’re not going to hire
            them. But it’s the right thing to do. We pull up feedback from their
            interviews and offer it to them so they can learn and grow, if they
            want it. We let them know that this is not a value judgement about
            them as a person and that interviewing is far from a science.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Another characteristic that helps Netlify win the hearts and minds
            of candidates - even of those they reject - is humility. They work
            hard to understand where they can get better and ask candidates for
            their feedback on how they can improve:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We know we’re not perfect. We treat candidates as human beings and
            let them know we are too. We let them know we make mistakes; that we
            can improve. We ask candidates for feedback on what we could do
            better and we tell them how we’re going to fix it.
          </blockquote>

            Underlying Principles of Netlify's Interview Process
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Candidate obsession:</strong> Putting in work upfront to
              offer candidates a better experience transforms the process and
              outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> A secret weapon that filters out
              the wrong candidates and naturally sells the right ones by helping
              them understand what it’s like to work at the company.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>(Over)communication:</strong> A widely available and under
              utilized asset that fixes process gaps and creates opportunities
              to connect with candidates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Org-wide recruiting:</strong> it’s a company-wide effort
              and the recruiting team serves as “the conductor that keeps the
              train on the tracks.”
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Narrator: Damn! We know there’s many ways to skin a cat but we’re
            confident if more companies emulated Netlify’s approach, the world
            would be a slightly better place (and more teams would hit their
            hiring goals).
