          <p>
            Today we‚Äôre excited to announce that the Resource business has been
            acquired by <a href="https://www.gem.com/">Gem</a>, and the team
            behind it is launching a new product and company ‚Äì
            <a href="https://guide.co/">Guide</a>, a bold attempt to redefine
            candidate experience for organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We launched Resource in 2016 with a belief that recruiters were
            underserved by technology. Software was indeed eating the world, yet
            recruiters were still cobbling together spreadsheets, snoozing
            emails and relying on memory to build relationships. Resource
            quickly grew to serve over 100 organizations across the world,
            facilitating thousands of hires and saving countless hours that
            freed recruiting teams to better leverage their time and enjoy their
            work. Today, we're excited to announce the next chapter for Resource
            and our team.
          </p>
          <h2 id="why-sell-and-why-gem">Why sell, and why Gem?</h2>
          <p>
            During our journey building sourcing software, my cofounder Austin
            and I became passionate about an adjacent problem we noticed: the
            relentless frustration of job seekers and lack of information
            empowering their decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019 we began a skunkworks project, now Guide, which drew more of
            our attention as it matured and ultimately led us to a tough truth:
            we were managing two products and couldn't give both the devotion
            users deserved. We had to pick one direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late January of 2021 we connected with Steve Bartel, Gem's CEO,
            and realized our goals were strongly aligned. As Gem continued to
            execute with rigor and hit escape velocity, we both believed Gem
            would better serve Resource's customers over the long term given the
            similarity of our products. This would also enable our team to spin
            out Guide as a standalone company to give it our undivided passion
            &amp; attention - something we felt it deserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led to a partnership with Gem we couldn‚Äôt be more excited about
            - a rare win-win-win for Resource, Gem and our customers, giving
            them a new home committed to their continued hiring and growth.
          </p>
          <h2 id="meet-guide-the-next-chapter-for-the-resource-team">
            Meet Guide, the next chapter for the Resource team
          </h2>
          <p>
            We‚Äôre thrilled to finally tell the world about
            <a href="https://guide.co/"
              >Guide - the Candidate Experience Company</a
            >, from the same team that brought you Resource. Guide is the first
            platform enabling talent teams to differentiate, streamline and
            measure the entire candidate lifecycle from sourcing to close.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, world-class organizations like One Medical, Gitlab, Reddit,
            Glossier and more are already using Guide to centralize and automate
            their interview collateral and see real-time insights on which
            candidates are engaged, all from a branded portal that candidates
            use as their home base during the hiring process.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can learn more about Guide
            <a href="https://guide.co/contact-sales/">here</a>. We're so excited
            for you to see it.

          <h2 id="we%E2%80%99re-grateful">We‚Äôre grateful..</h2>
          <p>
            To the many Resource customers who helped us edge recruiting
            software forward: we extend a heartfelt thank you. Our journey was
            possible because of your generous feedback and commitment to
            best-in-class recruiting practices. At Resource we were fortunate to
            work with some of the most forward-thinking companies, agencies and
            talent teams and we're thrilled to continue serving those same teams
            with the launch of Guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the entire recruiting community: we're grateful for your support.

          <p>And from all of us at Resource ‚Äì now Guide(!) ‚Äì thank you üíô</p>
